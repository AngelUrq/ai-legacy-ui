At    the     end     of    the     contact       interval,          the    blade      is    released\\nand    then      it    experiences            free,      damped       vibration          for    the    remainder          of   the\\nrevolution.              As    can     be    seen      from     the    Fig.      5,    the    blade      response         during\\nthe    time      of    free     vibration           is   a    function       of     the    damping       ratio      which      was\\nchosen        as    C -     0.01       throughout           this      analysis.

Using the\\nmaximum stress (220 psi) given in this table, it is easy to calculate\\nthe friction force necessary to create a given alternating                   stress.    For\\nexample,   an alternating       stress of 5000 psi rms would require a peak\\nfriction force of 22.7 pounds.            Assuming a coefficient          of friction of\\n0.2 would     translate    this into 114 pounds of normal                force, which is\\nentirely within the expected range.              Therefore, significant        alternating\\nstresses can be generated by blade tip rubbing.\\n                                           51\\n      In    slmm_ary,        the     turbine      blade       parametric         analysis        provided        several\\ninteresting          results.

blade tip rubbing stress prediction gerald a brusher gary a davis and daniel m shea rockwell internationalrocketdyne division canoga park california abstract a lnear analysis was performed to

as a half sine wave over a preselected contact arc the length of the contact arc as well as the pump speed was varied to determine the effects of each results show that for a given contact arc there are distinct critical speeds at which the blade response becomes a maximum introduction due to the requirement for high efficiency in modern turbomachinery clearances between turbine blade tips and the turbine housing are de sired to be as small as is practically possible an opposing design requirement is that the clearances be large enough to prevent rubbing of the blade tips on the housing due to rotor flexibility in practice a compromise is reached and a small amount of rubbing is tolerated for example in the space shuttle main engine ssme high pressure fuel turbopump fig i the firststage turbine blades experience light rubbing over approximately 20 to 30 degrees of arc to minimize tip rubbing while keeping the clearances as small as possible the turbine is mounted eccentrically in the pump housing under steadystate opera tion sideloads created by the pumping action of the impellers move the rotor to the centered position and no rubbing occurs during startup however the rotor blades contact the pump housing for a short period of time this has been observed in the turbine hardware during posttest inspections of the tip seal area a typical seal segment showing the light rub patterns is presented in fig 2 the purpose of the analysis presented herein was to assess the effects of tip rubbing on the dynamic response of turbine blades in particular the turbine blades of the
